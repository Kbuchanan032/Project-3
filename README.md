# Shelter-Finder
A group project created by Ivanna, Keith, Serguei, and Zac.

## Description
Our website helps users find nearby shelters with available beds and make a reservation to ensure their spot will be available for them once they are able to make their way to the shelter. It also allows providers a way to manage space in their shelters by allowing them to approve or deny requests for reservations, keep track of their current guests and available space, and keep a record of their past guests. 

## Motivation
The idea came from a concern with the current homelessness crisis affecting most major metropolitan areas. Our hope is that a more streamlined process for tracking availability will make it easier for shelters to serve the communities that depend on them, and provide a place where those needing accomodations may find the information they need.

## Results
Our website provides users with information on nearby shelters including their contact information, description, and whether or not they have beds available. It offers providers a place to track their availability and current guests, approve or deny requests for reservations, and keep a record of their past guests. 

When not signed in users can see the information about nearby shelters, as well as the shelter's location as a pin on the map. When a user creates an account and signs in they are able to request reservations from a registered shelter with available beds, as well as view a history of their shelter stays, and a list of their favorite shelters. 

Providers must create an account in order for their shelter to be "registered" and take reservations. Once an provider creates an account and signs in they will gain access to their dashboard and be able to accept or deny reservation requests, view a detailed list of their current guests, as well as a record of past guests.

## Instructions
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
